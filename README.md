# rig-fe
RIG FE is a simple API client for [XMRig CPU](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) and [XMRig-nvidia](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-nvidia)
(AMD version not tested but should work on theory) 
You can use it directly on https://chazzbg.github.io/rig-fe/ if you can expose your miner with https connection
